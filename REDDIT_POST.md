# ROM Librarian v1.2.0 - Free ROM Collection Manager

Just released v1.2.0 of my ROM collection manager with some major new features!

## What it does:

**CHD Conversion** - Convert disc images (CUE/BIN, ISO) to compressed CHD format. Includes chdman.exe, so no separate downloads needed.

**Smart Renaming** - Regex-based batch renaming with DAT file support (No-Intro). Now automatically updates CUE files when you rename BIN files - no more broken disc images!

**Duplicates Detection** - Content-based duplicate scanning with smart auto-selection (keep by region, size, date, etc.)

**Compression Tools** - Batch compress/extract ROMs to save space

**Multi-disc Support** - Auto-generate M3U playlists for games with multiple discs

**Collection Compare** - Compare two ROM folders to find missing files

## Key Features:

- Works with all major ROM formats (NES, SNES, Genesis, PlayStation, N64, GameCube, etc.)
- EmulationStation/RetroPie gamelist.xml auto-update
- Full undo support
- Persistent hash caching (blazing fast re-scans)
- Auto-updater built-in
- Completely free and open source

Available for Windows and Linux. No Python required - just download and run!
